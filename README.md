# **🎓 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction**

Predicting and preventing customer churn through data-driven insights

## **📋 Project Overview**

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as losing customers can significantly impact revenue and growth. In this graduation project, we use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze customer churn and build a prediction model to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving.

By leveraging various data-driven strategies, we aim to provide actionable insights that help businesses reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

## **🎯 Key Objectives**
- Understand the factors contributing to customer churn through exploratory data analysis.
- Build machine learning models that predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.
- Deploy the best-performing model to provide real-time churn predictions.

## **🔍 Problem Statement**

Businesses often face the challenge of customer attrition. Predicting which customers are likely to churn enables businesses to intervene before it’s too late. The goal is to develop a solution that can accurately predict churn and help decision-makers target at-risk customers with personalized strategies.

## **📊 Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project contains key information such as:

- **Demographics:** Gender, age, location
- **Account Information:** Contract type, tenure, payment method
- **Service Usage:** Products used, monthly charges
- **Churn Label:** Binary label indicating whether a customer churned or stayed


## **🛠 Project Workflow**

### This project follows a structured machine learning workflow, outlined as follows:

1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering the necessary data for customer churn.
2.	**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, feature scaling, and transformation.
3.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key patterns and relationships between features.
4.	**Model Development:**
    - Logistic Regression
	- Decision Trees
	- Random Forest
	- XGBoost
5.	**Model Evaluation:** Assessing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
6.	**Deployment:** Selecting and deploying the most accurate model.

## **📈 Key Insights**

- High churn risk is observed among customers with shorter tenures and those using specific payment methods.
- Monthly charges and contract type have a significant impact on customer churn predictions.
- The XGBoost model provided the most accurate results in predicting customer churn, with an accuracy of 95%.

## **🛠 Technologies Used**

- **Python:** Programming language
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For organizing the workflow
- **Flask & Streamlit:** For Deployment
